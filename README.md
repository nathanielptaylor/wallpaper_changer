# wallpaper changer
Grabs wallpapers from r/wallpaper and adds it to a folder.
This works with reddit's praw api to get wallpapers. I'm still looking for a way to run this automatically every so often. 
Right now, I have a workaround by using an infinite loop and inputs.
I also have a method to avoid downloading duplicate files.

NOTICE:
  This program is STILL IN BETA and NOT fully functional. Please report any bugs or problems to me, and I will take care of them.
  
ALSO: 
  The filepath for the downloaded photos will need to be changed to fit your computer.
